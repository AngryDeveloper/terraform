# Upgrading to Terraform v0.13

[Terraform v0.12 is a major release](blog posts link)
focused on configuration language improvements and thus includes some
changes that you'll need to consider when upgrading. The goal of this guide is
to cover the most common upgrade concerns and issues.

For most users, upgrading configuration should be completely automatic. Most
configurations can be prepared by running
[the automatic upgrade tool](/docs/commands/0.13upgrade.html). Please read on
for more information and recommendations on the upgrade process.
